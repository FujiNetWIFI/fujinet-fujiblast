# FujiBlast

FujiBlast is a bomb-maze game for two to four players over FujiNet. The first platform is the Atari 400/800/XL/XE with 48K, played with a joystick.

## How to play

- Drop bombs and blast blocks.
- Pick up powerups:
  - Fire: a longer blast.
  - Bomb Up: one more bomb at a time.
  - Speed.
  - Kick: walk into a bomb and it slides away.
  - Glove: press fire again while standing on your own bomb to throw it.
- Once in a while a bomb is a dud. Touching it might set it off again.
- The last player standing wins the round and a trophy. After the rounds the host picked, whoever has the most trophies wins. A tie goes to sudden death.

All the art and music are original. `gfx/*.png` is the master sheet that every port starts from; `tools/drawart.py` draws it.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `server/` | `fujiblastd`, the game server (Go). `blastbot` runs bots for tests and rigs. |
| `src/*.c` | The client, platform neutral. |
| `src/platform-specific/*.h` | The API each platform implements. |
| `src/atari/` | The Atari implementation: cc65, ANTIC mode 4, players and missiles, netstream. |
| `docs/PROTOCOL.md` | The wire protocol and the state layout. |
| `tools/` | The art converter and the emulator rigs. |

## Building

```
defoogi make atari      # r2r/atari/fujiblst.atr
make server             # server/fujiblastd, server/blastbot
make proto              # src/proto.h from the server's constants
```

`make SERVER=host:port` sets the server the game uses when the lobby gave none.

## Running a server

```
server/fujiblastd -stream :9910
server/blastbot -addr localhost:9910 -table dev1 -n 3 -start 4
```

`fujiblastd` serves tables `blast1`–`blast4` and the hidden `dev1`–`dev3`. It lists itself in the FujiNet lobby only when `FUJIBLAST_LOBBY` is set (lobby key 0x10).

## Testing

```
cd server && go test ./...
make -C tools/atarisim
python3 tools/atarisim/atarisim.py r2r/atari/fujiblst.atr build/fujiblst-atari.map SCENARIO OUTDIR
tools/atarisim/rig.sh SCRIPT OUTDIR
```

- `go test` covers the rules and the protocol.
- `atarisim.py` runs the offline test scenes from `src/test.c` in libatari800.
- `rig.sh` plays live in a private network namespace: server, bots, fujinet-pc and the emulator over NetSIO.
